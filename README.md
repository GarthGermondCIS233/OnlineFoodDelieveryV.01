### Plan
1. Analyze class relationships
2. Review design decisions
3. Explain architecture choices
4. Document patterns used

### Class Diagram Analysis

1. **Class Structure**
- `Customer`
  - Uses Long ID for database integration
  - Contains personal info (name, address, phone) for delivery
  - Methods focus on order placement and driver rating

2. **Relationships**
- Customer -(1:many)-> Order
  - One customer can place multiple orders
  - Orders track customer via customerID
- Order -(many:many)-> MenuItem
  - Orders contain multiple menu items
  - Items can be in multiple orders
- Driver -(1:many)-> Order
  - One driver handles multiple orders
  - Uses ID reference for efficiency

3. **Design Patterns**
- Observer Pattern
  - Order status changes notify relevant parties
- Strategy Pattern
  - Rating system uses circular buffer strategy
- Builder Pattern
  - Order construction is step-by-step

4. **Architecture Decisions**
- Used IDs instead of object references
  - Better database integration
  - Reduced memory footprint
  - Easier serialization
- Circular Buffer for Ratings
  - Efficient memory usage
  - FIFO implementation
  - Fixed size performance

5. **Data Types**
- Long for IDs
  - Scalable for large datasets
  - Standard database practice
- DateTime for timestamps
  - Precise order tracking
  - Timezone handling

This architecture supports:
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Database integration
- Clean separation of concerns


# Online Food Delivery System

This project is an online food delivery system that allows customers to place orders, rate drivers, and manage menu items. It is structured using Java and follows object-oriented principles.

## Features

- **Customer Management**: Customers can place orders and rate drivers.
- **Order Processing**: Orders are managed with statuses and can contain multiple menu items.
- **Driver Management**: Drivers can accept orders and have ratings stored in a circular buffer.
- **Menu Management**: Menu items can be created and managed, with the ability to extend for specific items.
- **Payment Integration**
    - Supports multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.)
    - Secure transaction processing
    - Order confirmation upon successful payment

## Usage of IDs rather than just names. 

- Create a `Customer` object to place orders and rate drivers.
- Use the `Order` class to manage order details and statuses.
- Implement the `Driver` class to handle order acceptance and rating updates.
- Define `MenuItem` objects for the available food items.
- **Integrate `Payment` objects to handle transactions**

Let's analyze why we use ID fields step by step:

1. **Database Integration**
   - IDs serve as primary keys in databases
   - Enable unique identification of each entity
   - Essential for persistence and data retrieval

2. **Relationship Management**
   - Allows referencing entities across the system
   - `Order` can reference `Customer` and `Driver` through their IDs
   - More efficient than storing entire objects

3. **Performance Benefits**
   - Faster lookups using numeric IDs vs other fields
   - Smaller memory footprint than using full objects
   - Efficient indexing in databases

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Ensures each entity is uniquely identifiable
   - Prevents duplicate entries
   - Simplifies data validation

5. **Best Practices**
   - Standard practice in enterprise applications
   - Follows database normalization principles
   - Enables scalability of the system

Therefore, IDs are essential for:
- Database integration
- Entity relationships
- System performance
- Data integrity
- Scalability
